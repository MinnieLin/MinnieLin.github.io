## Reminder

run `npm run dev` to start a local server, link is https://localhost:3000 or ctrl + left mouse click on the link

use app/page.tsx to change main page layout, components/footer.tsx controls the footer content, need to change the link, components/contact.tsx also need to change content, other thant that it should be fine

change teh content of app/publications/page.tsx, it is the top text content of the page.

for bibliography, it is called bibtex (when you to citation or stuff, you can choose to export the bibtex or ask gpt to convert it for you. and put in the publication.bib under the content folder we talked about.)

use content/ to add your own news, publications, or projects (content/assets are useless for now) (for documents, use markdown format, since it is .mdx, you keep the header)

lib/route.ts controls the header tag names
