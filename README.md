Welcome! I'm Qiyang, a PhD student in Computer Science at The University of Texas at Dallas, focusing on LLM, attack/defense and educational technology. This is my **third** iteration of my personal website, built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

The design of this site draws inspiration from the amazing work of [Jeff Jadulco](https://jeffjadulco.com/) and [Victor Dibia](https://victordibia.com/). Their thoughtful design approaches have influenced how I present my work and research here.

I use this space to share my research, projects, and thoughts on anything I found interesting. Feel free to explore my publications, projects, and blog posts to learn more about my work.

## Old version

My old version is built with [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio), you can find it [here](https://github.com/Asonjay/al_folio_deprecated).
