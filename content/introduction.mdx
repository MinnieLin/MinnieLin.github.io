I am a Ph.D. candidate in Educational Psychology and Educational Technology at Michigan State University (MSU), advised by [Dr. Rand Spiro](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yvqvXt0AAAAJ&hl=en). My research investigates how individual differences, motivation, and cognitive flexibility shape learning with emerging technologies such as virtual reality, games, and generative AI. Grounded in Cognitive Flexibility Theory, I integrate psychological theory with user-centered design to create evidence-based, technology-enhanced learning experiences.

My research program is organized into three interconnected streams. The first explores the use of virtual reality in formal classrooms, where I collaborate with [Dr. Rabindra Ratan](https://comartsci.msu.edu/our-people/rabindra-ratan) and [Dr. Jeremy Bailenson](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=w_JYUtkAAAAJ&hl=en) at [Stanford's Virtual Human Interaction Lab](https://vhil.stanford.edu/people/jeremy-bailenson) to study its impact on social presence and fatigue. My second line of research focuses on game-based learning. working with [Dr. Fangzheng Zhao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Bpq_SfQAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr. Richard Mayer](https://mayerlab.psych.ucsb.edu/people/richard-mayer) to understand how game mechanics and individual' cognitive flexibility level promote the transfer of problem-solving skills. A third stream,in collaboration with [Dr. Elizabeth Cloude](https://ecloude.github.io/), we study how emotions and self-regualtion shape learning using multimodel data.These projects culminate in my dissertation on generative AI, where I am developing an AI-powered metacognitive partner using CFT-based prompt to help students reflect and adapt while engaging with complex problems.

Across these projects, I have built a trajectory as both an independent scholar and a collaborative researcher. I value interdisciplinary partnerships. Having worked with scholars in psychology, education, communication, and computer science, my work bridges theory and design to advance both research and practice. My goal is to create impactful learning solutions that not only advance scholarship in motivation and learning sciences but also translate into effective, real-world applications.

Beyond academia, I enjoy playing games and am working on a certificate in [Serious Game Design & Development](https://comartsci.msu.edu/academics/academic-departments/media-information/graduate/serious-games-graduate-certificate), further bridging my passion for games with my academic and professional goals.
