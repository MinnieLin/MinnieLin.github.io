I am a Ph.D. candidate in Educational Psychology and Educational Technology at Michigan State University (MSU), advised by [Dr. Rand Spiro](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yvqvXt0AAAAJ&hl=en). My research examines the intersection of individual differences, motivation, and emerging technologies such as virtual reality, games, and generative AI. By integrating psychological theory with user-centered design, I aim to create evidence-based, technology-enhanced learning experiences that are both engaging and effective.

My research program is organized into three interconnected streams. The first explores the use of virtual reality in formal classrooms, where I collaborate with [Dr. Rabindra Ratan](https://comartsci.msu.edu/our-people/rabindra-ratan) and [Stanford's Virtual Human Interaction Lab](https://vhil.stanford.edu/people/jeremy-bailenson) to study its impact on social presence and fatigue. My second line of research focuses on game-based learning. I worked with [Dr. Fangzheng Zhao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Bpq_SfQAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr. Richard Mayer](https://mayerlab.psych.ucsb.edu/) to understand how game mechanics can promote the transfer of problem-solving skills. Currently, in collaboration with [Dr. Elizabeth Cloude](https://ecloude.github.io/), we study how emotions and self-regualtion shape learning using multimodel data.

The culmination of my work is my dissertation on generative AI, where I am developing an AI-powered tool that acts as a metacognitive partner. This tool is designed to help students reflect on their thinking and adapt their strategies while tackling complex problems. Across all my projects, I employ a mix of quantitative and qualitative methods to gather robust data in classroom, lab, and informal learning contexts.

Prior to MSU, I completed both my M.A. in Cognitive Science in Education at Teachers College, Columbia University, working with [Dr. Janet Metcalfe](https://psychology.columbia.edu/content/janet-metcalfe) on metacognition and [Dr. Lesile Fraizer](https://frazierlab.wixsite.com/frazierpsyfiu) on playfulness. I completed my undergraduate studies in Psychology at the University of California, San Diego, working with [Dr. Emma Geller](https://www.lime-lab-ucsd.com/) on instructional design. 

Beyond academia, I enjoy playing games and am currently earning a certificate in Serious Game Design & Development, further bridging my passion for games with my academic and professional goals.
